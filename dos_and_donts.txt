COVID-19 Prevention Guidelines:

Do's:

Wear Masks: Always wear masks in 
public settings.


Practice Hand Hygiene: Wash your hands 
frequently with soap and water for at 
least 20 seconds. If soap and water are 
unavailable, use hand sanitizer with 
at least 60% alcohol content.

Maintain Physical Distancing: Stay at least
6 feet away from people who are not part 
of your household, especially in crowded 
places or enclosed spaces.

Stay Home if Sick: If you feel unwell, 
experience COVID-19 symptoms, or have 
been in contact with someone who tested 
positive, stay home and seek medical 
advice if necessary.

Cover Coughs and Sneezes: Use a tissue 
or your elbow to cover your mouth and nose 
when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of 
tissues properly.

Ventilate Indoor Spaces: Ensure proper 
ventilation in indoor areas to reduce 
the concentration of viral particles.

Get Vaccinated: If you are eligible, 
get vaccinated against COVID-19. 

Don'ts:

Avoid Crowded Places: Minimize attendance 
at large gatherings, crowded events, and 
non-essential gatherings where physical 
distancing might be difficult.

Limit Close Contact: Avoid close contact 
with individuals outside your household, 
especially if they exhibit symptoms or 
have been exposed to COVID-19.

Avoid Touching Face: Refrain from touching 
your eyes, nose, and mouth, as the virus 
can enter your body through these areas if 
your hands are contaminated.

Don't Share Personal Items: Avoid sharing 
personal items such as utensils, cups, 
towels, or electronic devices to prevent 
potential transmission.

Take Symptoms Seriously: If you experience any 
COVID-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, take them 
seriously, and seek medical advice promptly. 
Get tested if recommended by health authorities.

Limit Unnecessary Travel: Avoid non-essential travel, 
especially to areas with high transmission 
rates or travel restrictions.

Following these comprehensive guidelines 
diligently can significantly reduce your risk of 
contracting and spreading COVID-19. It's crucial to 
stay informed about the COVID-19 situation in your 
area and adhere to guidelines provided by local 
health authorities to protect yourself and others.
